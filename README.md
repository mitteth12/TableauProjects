# TableauProjects

This repository will serve as a place to hold all of the Tableau analysis that I produce. I could use Tableau public, but decided to keep all of my data science work together in one spot by putting all of my Tableau work into Github. The repository will include the workbook used to accomplish the dashboard as well as a screenshot of the dashboard for each analysis.
