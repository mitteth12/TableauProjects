# TableauProjects

This repository will serve as a place to hold all of the Tableau analysis that I produce. I could use Tableau public, but decided to keep all of my data science work together in one spot by putting all of my Tableau work into Github. In this repository I will be saving all of my dashboards in the form of a png screenshot. In this way it is a little ineffective for storage because there will be no interactivity, but I still will get to store all of my final products which I find useful.
